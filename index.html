                  Hello and thank you for considering me for your position.
                  My name is Hunter Parks and I grew up in Southern Indiana. I moved to Portland to get away from the boring redneck life and to be closer to my family. I am now an on-coming junior web developer for-hire looking to expand my knowledge with coding and computers.
                </p>
